Add a remote server (e.g., 10.0.0.175:47842)\n2. Select the remote server as active model\n3. Record audio using hotkey\n4. Observe: Transcription uses local whisper::transcriber, not remote\n\n## Evidence from Logs\n```\n[01:36:48] Active remote server set to: conn_1768440766671_0\n[subsequent transcription still shows:]\nvoicetypr_lib::whisper::transcriber  \u003c-- LOCAL, not remote\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhen remote server is active, transcription should:\n1. Send audio to remote server via HTTP\n2. Show logs like `remote::client` or `remote::transcription`\n3. NOT use local whisper::transcriber\n\n## Files to Investigate\n- src-tauri/src/commands/audio.rs - transcription flow\n- src-tauri/src/remote/client.rs - remote client\n- src-tauri/src/commands/remote.rs - remote commands\n- Check how active model selection is checked during transcription\n\n## Possible Causes\n1.

The code explicitly returns an error. This feature request is to add remote server support to file upload transcription.\n\n## Current Behavior\n- User selects remote server as active model\n- User goes to History tab → Upload Audio  \n- Error: 'File upload transcription is not supported for remote server X'\n\n## Desired Behavior\n- File upload should work with remote servers\n- Audio file is sent to remote server for transcription\n- Result is saved to history like local transcription\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Guide\n\n### Files to Modify\n\n**1. src-tauri/src/commands/audio.rs**\n\nTwo functions need updating:\n\n#### transcribe_file() - around line 2495\nCurrent code returns error:\n```rust\nActiveEngineSelection::Remote { server_name, .. } =\u003e {\n    return Err(format\\!(\n        \"File upload transcription is not supported for remote server '{}'. \\\n        Please select a local model for file transcription.\",\n        server_name\n    ));\n}\n```\n\nReplace with remote transcription logic (reference the live recording implementation around line 1770-1830):\n```rust\nActiveEngineSelection::Remote { host, port, password, server_name } =\u003e {\n    // Read the audio file\n    let audio_data = std::fs::read(\u0026wav_path)\n        .map_err(|e| format\\!(\"Failed to read audio file: {}\", e))?;\n    \n    // Create HTTP client connection\n    let server_conn = RemoteServerConnection::new(\n        host.clone(),\n        *port,\n        password.clone(),\n    );\n    \n    // Send transcription request\n    let client = reqwest::Client::new();\n    let mut request = client\n        .post(\u0026server_conn.transcribe_url())\n        .header(\"Content-Type\", \"audio/wav\")\n        .body(audio_data);\n    \n    if let Some(pwd) = server_conn.password.as_ref() {\n        request = request.header(\"X-VoiceTypr-Key\", pwd);\n    }\n    \n    let response = request.send().await.map_err(|e| {\n        format\\!(\"Failed to connect to remote server '{}': {}\", server_name, e)\n    })?;\n    \n    if response.status() == reqwest::StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED {\n        return Err(\"Remote server authentication failed\".to_string());\n    }\n    \n    if \\!response.status().is_success() {\n        return Err(format\\!(\"Remote server error: {}\", response.status()));\n    }\n    \n    let result: serde_json::Value = response.json().await\n        .map_err(|e| format\\!(\"Failed to parse response: {}\", e))?;\n    \n    result.get(\"text\")\n        .and_then(|v| v.as_str())\n        .map(|s| s.to_string())\n        .ok_or_else(|| \"Invalid response: missing 'text' field\".to_string())?\n}\n```\n\n#### transcribe_clipboard() - around line 2607\nSame pattern as transcribe_file - replace the error with remote transcription logic.\n\n### Required Imports\nAdd to top of audio.rs if not present:\n```rust\nuse crate::remote::client::RemoteServerConnection;\n```\n\n### Model Name for History\nWhen saving to history, use the server_name instead of local model name:\n```rust\n// For remote transcription, use server name as the model\nlet model_for_history = match \u0026engine_selection {\n    ActiveEngineSelection::Remote { server_name, .. } =\u003e format\\!(\"Remote: {}\", server_name),\n    _ =\u003e model_name.clone(),\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n1. **Basic upload**: Small audio file (\u003c 1MB) via remote server\n2. **Large file**: Test with 10+ MB audio file (check timeout handling)\n3. **Server offline**: Upload while remote server unavailable (should show notification)\n4. **Clipboard transcription**: Same functionality for clipboard audio\n5. **History entry**: Verify history shows 'Remote: ServerName' as model\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] File upload works when remote server selected\n- [ ] Large files handled properly (may need increased timeout)\n- [ ] Error handling matches live recording (notification + toast)\n- [ ] History entry shows remote server name\n- [ ] Clipboard transcription also works with remote server\n\n## Reference Code\n\nSee live recording remote transcription implementation:\n- src-tauri/src/commands/audio.rs lines 1770-1830\n- src-tauri/src/commands/remote.rs (transcribe_remote function)\n- src-tauri/src/remote/client.rs (RemoteServerConnection)\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"tchapin@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T21:10:58.950816-08:00","created_by":"Tom Chapin","updated_at":"2026-01-14T21:12:07.662192-08:00"}
